# Team Project
```
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"
```

## FAQs from yesterday:

* **How many datasets do you need to use in your analysis?**
    * Yesterday we mentioned you could look at 3 datasets as a start, and add more data sets if your project requires it.
    * 3 datasets is **NOT** a requirement.
    * If you are able to build your use case and analysis with a single data set, you can do so.

## FAQs from yesterday:

* **What if you don't think you can use the same data for the second part of the Team Project?**
    * The second part of the Team Project is meant to extend what you built in the first part.
    * It is ok to augment your data set or add new data sets as needed, but the goal is to show that you can apply the additional skills you will learn towards the same business case.
