Our team decided to tackle a healthcare-related project by selecting a dataset from Kaggle that consisted of chest X-ray images. Our aim was to develop an image classifier specifically designed to identify pneumonia from these X-rays. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, processed the data accordingly, and proceeded to build a logistic regression model for our analysis.
