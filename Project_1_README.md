# Life Expectancy Analysis Project
Team #27: Maryna Kostiuk, Ying Li, Yinglin Zhang, Tetiana Nurkanova


### Project Overview

Welcome to our Life Expectancy Analysis Project. Our team has undertaken the task of exploring and analyzing the factors that influence life expectancy across different countries. Using a comprehensive dataset, we aim to build a robust multiple regression model to identify key determinants and their impact on life expectancy. We aim to answer the questions: 
1. What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
3. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
4. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
5. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
6. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?

### Project Objectives
**Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for regression analysis.

**Regression Modelling:** Develop and fine-tune a multiple regression model to understand the relationship between various factors and life expectancy.

**Plotting and Visualization:** Create insightful visualizations to illustrate the findings and support the analysis.

**Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance and reliability of the regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics.



### Team Approach
Our team collaborated extensively over Zoom meetings and over the Slack to ensure effective communication and a smooth workflow. The project was divided into four main parts, with each team member taking responsibility for one aspect of the project.

### Division of Responsibilities
**Data Preparation:**

Team Member: Maryna Kostiuk
Responsibilities: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating the correlation matrix to identify initial patterns and correlations.

**Regression Modelling:**

Team Member: Ying Li
Responsibilities: Selecting the appropriate features, building and optimizing the multiple regression models, and ensuring the models meet the assumptions of regression analysis.

**Plotting and Visualization:**

Team Member: Yinglin Zhang
Responsibilities: Creating visual representations of data trends, model diagnostics, and results to effectively communicate the insights drawn from the analysis.

**Model Evaluation:**

Team Member: Tetiana Nurkanova
Responsibilities: Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Residual Plots. Checking for overfitting and ensuring the model’s generalizability.




### Workflow and Collaboration
**Communication:** Regular Zoom meetings were held to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.

**Code Quality:** We emphasized frequent code commenting to ensure clarity and facilitate understanding for all team members and future users.

**Documentation:** Each part of the project is well-documented, detailing the process, methods used, and findings.



**To maintain a productive and respectful working environment, our team established the following rules:**

Respect and Professionalism: All team interactions should be respectful and professional.
Commitment to Deadlines: Each member should adhere to agreed-upon deadlines and communicate promptly if there are any delays.
Collaboration and Support: Help each other with challenges and provide constructive feedback.
Regular Updates: Share progress regularly and keep the team informed of any changes or issues.
Code Quality: Ensure that code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to our project’s standards.


### Conclusion
This project represents a collaborative effort to understand the factors affecting life expectancy through a comprehensive data analysis and modeling approach.
