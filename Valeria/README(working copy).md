# Team Project - Team 25

### Description  

We are students enrolled in the Data Science Certificate program at the Data Science Institute and University of Toronto. Our team originally comprised five enthusiastic members, but only four of us are actively participating, as one member has not attended any group meetings or responded to direct messages.
Despite this challenge, we have successfully navigated our initial meetings, brainstorming sessions, and topic selection process. Through collaborative discussions, we identified the economic impact of immigration on the housing market as a compelling and relevant area of study. Additionally, we decided to analyze the aspect of emigration, exploring why people become immigrants and then leave the country. Our focus will be to explore how immigration and emigration affect housing availability and pricing, an issue of significant importance in today’s globalized world and especially pertinent to Toronto, a city known for its diverse immigrant population and dynamic real estate market.
This project aims to delve into the intricate relationships between immigration trends, emigration patterns, and housing market dynamics. By analyzing various data sources and applying statistical methods, we aspire to uncover patterns and provide insights that could inform policymakers, real estate professionals, and the general public. Our journey begins here, as we set out to answer critical questions about the intersection of immigration, emigration, and housing, contributing to a deeper understanding of these complex economic phenomena.

## Team Member 4 – Summary of Activities for the Week 1

I made significant progress during the first week, focusing on data preparation and preliminary analysis. Below is a detailed summary of my accomplishments:
1. Downloaded Housing Open Data:
 ◦ Acquired relevant datasets on housing from open data sources.
2. Cleaned Data in Python:
  ◦ Leveraged Python for data cleaning, ensuring that the datasets were in a usable format.
  ◦ A team member with expertise in this area provided valuable guidance and support.
3. Merged Data:
  ◦ Successfully combined multiple datasets to create a comprehensive merged dataset for analysis of immigration and the increase in rental prices.
4. Challenges Encountered:
  Inconsistent Variables: Some variables had different formats or definitions across datasets, necessitating additional data cleaning and rework.

Despite these challenges, I was able to clear the issues and make significant headway, laying a strong foundation for the team's analysis moving forward. Further analysis is required from the team for the rental and housing component before any conclusions or recommendations can be made.
